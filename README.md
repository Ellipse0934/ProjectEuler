My solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

As per forum admin, providing solutions for the 1st 100 problems is A-OKAY. The reason is that it's been already widely discussed and no point restricting others from publishing solutions.

Final goal is to have the 1st 100 problems along with an elementary benchmark.
